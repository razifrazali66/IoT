  Simple Blink Sketch for ESP8266 Onboard LED

  This sketch blinks the onboard LED of an ESP8266 development board.
  The LED_BUILTIN constant is typically defined to the correct GPIO pin
  for the onboard LED (e.g., GPIO2 for NodeMCU, which is D4).

  The onboard LED on many ESP8266 boards is active LOW,
  meaning:
  - LOW turns the LED ON
  - HIGH turns the LED OFF

// If LED_BUILTIN is not defined for your specific board variant,
// you might need to define it yourself. For NodeMCU, it's usually D4 (GPIO2).
// #ifndef LED_BUILTIN
// #define LED_BUILTIN 2 // GPIO2 is D4 on NodeMCU
// #endif

void setup() {
  // Initialize the digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);

  Serial.begin(115200); // Optional: for debug messages
  Serial.println("ESP8266 Blink Sketch Started!");
  Serial.print("Using LED_BUILTIN, which should be GPIO: ");
  Serial.println(LED_BUILTIN); // Print the GPIO number LED_BUILTIN maps to
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // Turn the LED ON (assuming active LOW)
  Serial.println("LED ON");        // Optional: print status to Serial Monitor
  delay(1000);                      // Wait for a second

  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // Turn the LED OFF (assuming active LOW)
  Serial.println("LED OFF");       // Optional: print status to Serial Monitor
  delay(1000);                      // Wait for another second
